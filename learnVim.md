### 1. Introduction

vi([vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi)) is a screen-oriented text editor that was originally created for the Unix OS back in 1976. In 1991 a new version called Vim([vi IMproved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor))) has been born that brings additions to the original editor created by Bill Joy.

At this point in time, Vim is found on all Unix based operating systems. As you will find it on all Unix based OS, you will also find it when accessing a server to work on it. Most servers running are using Linux as their OS (most of the time they run on Ubuntu, RedHat/CentOS or SuseLinux). Windows and IIS is still used, but their percentage for new servers is quite small. They mainly run on legacy apps that can not be converted.

When you connect to a server, the first thing that will great you is the terminal and not the graphical interface. As you only have access to the terminal, tools like VS Code, Sublime or other text editors will not be available, but Vim will. You might be able to edit the files using nano([GNU Nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano)), but it might not be installed on all running servers, as such as mentioned above Vim will be.

We do not need to be a master at Vim, but if you want you will become a much faster programmer as everything in Vim is done from the keyboard rather then using the mouse and keyboard.
